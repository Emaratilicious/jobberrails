== JobberRails

JobberRails is a conversion of the excellent open source php web app, JobberBase, to Rails.
www.jobberbase.com

== Install Instructions

1) Set up Database (database.yml)

2) Run rake db:create db:migrate db:seed

3) Start server

 
== Hosted Version

The latest version is currently running on a MorphExchange developer account here:
http://jobberrails.git


== S3 Support for Resumes

To store uploaded resume files in S3, update job_applicant.rb changing the :storage mechanism from
:file_system to :s3. You'll also need to create a config/amazon_s3.yml with the following yml format:

    development:
      bucket_name: appname_development
      access_key_id:
      secret_access_key:
     
    test:
      bucket_name: appname_test
      access_key_id:
      secret_access_key:
     
    production:
      bucket_name: appname
      access_key_id:
      secret_access_key:


== Current Version

v0.0.0.0.1. Very incomplete. Basically its the result of me hacking for 4 hours and seeing how far I get. 

So far it has Job Posting, listing, and categorization.

v1.0 will include all the functionality that currently exists in JobberBase


== Help
